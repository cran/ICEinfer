\title{Compute Preference Colors for Outcomes in a Bootstrap ICE Scatter within a Confidence Wedge}
\description{
 Assuming ICEw is an object of class ICEwedge, ICEcolor uses the value of lambda given
 by lfact * (ICEw item lambda) and the ICE Preference Map with parameters beta and gamma to compute
 the Economic Preference value for only the points in a Bootstrap Distribution of ICE Uncertainty
 that also happen to fall within the ICE confidence wedge.  When the overall level of confidence
 (statistical size of the wedge) is held fixed, the points to be colored are always the very same
 points for all choices of lambda.  However, the numerical value of preference (and thus the color)
 for each such point as well as potential overall asymmetry in the resulting ICE map do depend
 greatly upon choice of lambda. 
}
\usage{
 ICEcolor(ICEw, lfact = 1, beta = 1, gamma = 3+2*sqrt(2)) 
}
\arguments{
  \item{ICEw}{Existing ICEwedge object.}
  \item{lfact}{Strictly positive multiplier for ICEw item lambda.}
  \item{beta}{Strictly positive Returns-to-Scale power parameter for the ICE
   Preference Map.  beta = 1 implies linear (constant) Returns to Scale.  beta > 0 and < 1
   implies diminishing Returns to Scale.  beta > 1 implies increasing Returns to Scale.}
  \item{gamma}{Strictly positive Directional power parameter.  The smallest reasonable value
   for gamma is usually gamma = beta, which yields a (generalized) linear map.  The largest
   reasonable value for gamma is usually gamma = beta*(3+2*sgrt(2)), which yields a map that
   satisfies the Cartesian Monotonicity Axiom and also admits all possible finite values for
   WTP and WTA, i.e. all values greater than or equal to 0 but less than +Inf.}
}
\details{Multiple calls to ICEcolor() are usually made for different lfact multipliers of the
  lambda item within ICEw as well as different choices for the ICE Preference power parameters,
  beta and gamma.  Calls to plot(x, alibi) for these alternative ICEcolor x-objects can be used
  to illustrate that exogenous Economic Uncertainty can literally SWAMP the Statistical
  Uncertainty endogenous to patient level data on the relative cost and effectiveness of two
  treatments.
