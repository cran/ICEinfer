 ICEscale() functions compute or print ICE Statistical Inference Summary Statistics
 relative to choice for the numerical value of the Shadow Price of Health, lambda
}
\description{
 ICEscale() computes Summary Statistics for 2-sample, 2-variable inference where one variable
 is a measure of effectiveness (higher values are better) and the other variable is a measure
 of cost (lower values are better).  The 2 samples are of patients receiving only 1 of the 2
 possible treatments.  The treatment called new is the one with the higher numerical level
 for the specified treatment indicator variable, while the treatment called std corresponds
 to the lower numerical level.  The pivotal statistic for inference is (DeltaEffe, DeltaCost),
 which are the head-to-head mean differences for new treatment minus std treatment.  Each
 sample is assumed to provide unbiased estimates of the overall expected effectiveness and cost
 for that treatment.
}
\usage{
ICEscale(df, trtm, xeffe, ycost, lambda = 1, unit = cost)
}
\arguments{
  \item{df}{Required; Existing data.frame object containing the trtm, xeffe and ycost variables.}
  \item{trtm}{Required; Name of the treatment indicator variable contained within the df
   data.frame that assumes one of only two different numerical values for each patient.}
  \item{xeffe}{Required; Name of the treatment effectiveness variable within the df data.frame.}
  \item{ycost}{Required; Name of the treatment cost variable within the df data.frame.}
  \item{lambda}{Optional; \code{lambda} strictly positive value for the Shadow Price of Health.}
  \item{unit}{Optional; \code{unit} character string containing either cost (default) or effe.}
}
\details{
  After an initial call with the default value of lambda = 1, multiple additional calls to
  ICEscale() with different numerical values for lambda are usually made at the very beginning of
  analyses using other functions from the ICEinfer package.  For example, the statistical
  choice for lambda assures that the DeltaEffe and DeltaCost mean treatment differences (new
  minus std) will have approximately equal variability when expressed in either cost or
  effe units.  The power of ten value of lambda that is closest to the statistical value
  for lambda assures use of units that, except for the position of the decimal point, are identical
  to the cost/effectiveness ratio implied by the scales in which data values are stored within
  the input data.frame.
