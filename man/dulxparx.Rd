\title{Data for the High Uncertainty numerical example of Obenchain et al. (2005) from
 a double-blind clinical trial comparing duloxetine (an SNRI) with paroxetine (an SSRI) 
 described in Goldstein et al. (2004).
}
\description{The data are from two arms of a double-blind clinical trial in which 91 patients
 were randomized to duloxetine 80 mg/d (40 mg BID) and 87 patients were randomized to paroxetine
 20 mg/d for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).  Missing-data-imputation and
 sensitivity-analyses were needed to make meaningful cost-effectiveness comparisons in this study.

\usage{data(dulxparx)}
\format{
  A data frame of 3 variables on 178 patients; no NAs.
  \describe{
    \item{idb}{This measure of overall effectiveness is \emph{integrated decrease in HAMD-17
     score from baseline to endpoint}, Hamilton (1967).  This is a (signed) area-under-the-curve
     measure with larger values more favorable.  Missing values were imputed via the MMRM models
     reported in Goldstein et al. (2004).
     }
    \item{ru}{Patient self-reported health-care resource utilization above and beyond that
     provided within study protocol was collected using the Resource Utilization Survey,
     Copley-Merriman et al. (1992), with published 1998 dollars-per-unit costs, Schoenbaum et al. (2001),
     rounded to the nearest 50 dollars.  Dollars/week were then calculated by multiplying (total accumulated
     cost) for a patient by 7 and dividing by the (total days of cost accumulation) for that
     patient.  For patients who discontinued early, this is Average-Value-Carried-Forward
     imputation.
     }
    \item{dulx}{Treatment indicator variable. dulx = 1 implies receipt of duloxetine 80 mg/d
     (40 mg BID). dulx = 0 implies receipt of paroxetine 20 mg/d.
