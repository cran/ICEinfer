\title{Equivariant Wedge-Shaped ICE Region with Confidence Level from 0.50 to 0.99}
\description{
  ICEwedge() uses the Bootstrap Distribution of ICE Uncertainty generated by ICEuncrt()
  to calculate and sort ICE Angle Order Statistics around a circle.  ICEwedge() then
  counts outwards the same number of ICE Angle Order Statistics, floor(R*conf/2), both
  Counter-Clockwise and Clockwise from the so-called center Order Statistic (the one
  nearest to the Observed ICE Ratio) to define a pair of ICE Ray Endpoints at ICE Angle
  Order Statistics (reported as numbers jlo and kup, respectively) that subtend an ICE
  Polar Angle reported as being of subangle in degrees.
}
\usage{
ICEwedge(ICEu, lfact = 1, conf = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ICEu}{Output list object of class ICEuncrt.}
  \item{lfact}{Either a strictly positive multiplicative factor for ICEu item lambda
   or else 0 to cause ICEwedge to compute the positive lfact and lambda values which
   transforms the alibi display so that it has an alias interpretation.}
  \item{conf}{Statistical Confidence Level within [0.50, 0.99].}
}
\details{
 The plot() of an object of class ICEwedge displays the Bootstrap Distribution of ICE
 Uncertainty with a small, circular, colored dot (pch = 20).  Outcomes outside the Wedge
 are displayed in black, while outcomes inside the Wedge are displayed in cyan.  Upper
 and lower ICE Ray Limits are displayed as solid black lines, and the ICE Ray through
 the center ICE Angle Order Statistic is shown as a dashed black line.
}
\value{
  An object of class ICEwedge with the following output list:
  \item{ICEinp}{Name of the ICEuncrt object input to ICEwedge().}
  \item{lambda}{Positive value of lfact * ICEu item lambda}
  \item{lfact}{Positive Multiplier for the ICEu item lambda value input to ICEwedge().}  
  \item{unit}{Saved value of unit, cost or effe, input to ICEuncrt.}
  \item{conf}{Statistical Confidence Level within [0.50, 0.99] input to ICEwedge.}  
  \item{R}{Saved integer value for number of bootstrap replications input to ICEuncrt.}
  \item{axys}{R x 4 data.frame with ICE Angle in column 1, bootstrap resampled values of
   (DeltaEffe, DeltaCost) in columns 2 and 3, and the binary flag with 0 => outcome outSide the 
   Confidence Wedge and 1 => outcome inSide the Confidence Wedge in column 4.}  
  \item{t1}{Observed value of (DeltaEffe, DeltaCost) when each patient is sampled exactly once.}
  \item{ia1}{The center ICE Angle closest to the Objerved ICE Ratio.}
  \item{center}{The largest value of j such that axys[j, 1] < ia1 <= axys[j+1, 1].}
  \item{jlo}{Number of the ICE Angle Order Statistic defining the Clockwise or lower ICE Ray
   boundary of the Confidence Wedge.}
  \item{kup}{Number of the ICE Angle Order Statistic defining the Counter-Clockwise or upper
   ICE Ray boundary of the Confidence Wedge.}
  \item{subangle}{Subtended Polar ICE Angle between Order Statistics numbers jlo and kup.}
  \item{xmax}{Alias plots of ICEwedge have horizontal range [-xmax, +xmax].}
  \item{ymax}{Alias plots of ICEwedge have vertical range [-ymax, +ymax].}
  \item{ab}{ICE angle computation perspective of alibi or alias.}
